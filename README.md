# Coding A Medium Article

The article I'm working on today is [How I built my Startup as a solo developer by Sushrit Pasupuleti](https://medium.com/@sushrit.pk21/how-i-built-my-startup-as-a-solo-developer-8561bf7eebde)

## Why Am I Doing This? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
During the course of taking a deeper dive into HTML, primarily through taking courses by [Jen Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen4web/) on [LinkedIn Learning](https://bit.ly/3VkpvwB) I realised that a lot of the HTML I had been writing before was simply just <strong>a coat hanger for my CSS</strong>. It was there simply to provide the content for my CSS to be able to style. I didn't really give much thought to things like <strong>accessibility, structure, semantics</strong>, choosing to care more about just having a live version of my build that <em>looked</em> right. 

So, I've decided to stop trying to speedrun through complex projects that will only further establish that shakey foundation, and instead take on smaller projects that would allow me to be more <em>intentional</em> with my code.

For this project, I decided to code three [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles, which I believe, although not enough to solidify the new things I have learned about semantic HTML into my coding brain, it would most definitely be <strong>good practice</strong>, and something that I can update if needs be the more I learn, and also provide me a <strong>template to refer to in future builds</strong>.

## Some things I Learned in the course of doing this üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª
- OG Tags - which are tags used to control the display of a URL when shared on social media. [Learn more about OG Tags here](https://ahrefs.com/blog/open-graph-meta-tags/)
- If you are writing a period of time, for example 5 minutes, you would need to prefix the datetime value with PT which stands for Period (P) and Time (T). This specifies that the period only consists of time and not a date. [More on how to use the time tag to represent durations in this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51168022/what-does-pt-prefix-stand-for-in-duration)

## Some questions I had based on the project
- I was unable to load multiple fonts in my CSS. I got the fonts from the Medium website by using [this method](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-find-webpages-font-inspect-element-tool-browser-extensions/#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20webpage.,fonts%20used%20on%20the%20webpage.), but was unable to load the Sohne font for the heading text properly for some reason. Any ideas?
