# Coding A Medium Article

## Why Am I Doing This?
During the course of taking a deeper dive into HTML, primarily through taking courses by [Jen Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen4web/) on [LinkedIn Learning](https://bit.ly/3VkpvwB) I realised that a lot of the HTML I had been writing before was simply just <strong>a coat hanger for my CSS</strong>. It was there simply to provide the content for my CSS to be able to style. I didn't really give much thought to things like <strong>accessibility, structure, semantics</strong>, choosing to care more about just having a live version of my build that <em>looked</em> right. 

So, I've decided to stop trying to speedrun through complex projects that will only further establish that shakey foundation, and instead take on smaller projects that would allow me to be more <em>intentional</em> with my code.

For this project, I decided to code three [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles, which I believe, although not enough to solidify the new things I have learned about semantic HTML into my coding brain, it would most definitely be <strong>good practice</strong>, and something that I can update if needs be the more I learn, and also provide me a <strong>template to refer to in future builds</strong>.

## Some things I Learned in the course of doing this.
