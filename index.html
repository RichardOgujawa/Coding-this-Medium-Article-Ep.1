            <p> This article will detail my journey from a Full Stack Engineer to Startup founder over the course of 10
                months. Throughout this article I’ll explain the rationale behind choosing each part of my stack and how
                it played out in the end.</p>
            <p>So strap in, it is going to be a long yet fun article!</p>
            <h2>So what is my Startup about?</h2>
            <p>Well, it took a couple of weeks to get a clean pitch drafted so I’ll lead with that.</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://skillshack.dev/" target="_blank">skillShack(⚡);</a> is a community for software

            <p>
                With “<a href="https://skillshack.dev/" target="_blank">skillShack(⚡)</a>” I wanted to build a platform
                for
                developers to share the projects they are working on, and
                for those stuck in tutorial hell provide a curated list of challenges that can be built into projects to
                put
                their skills to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been my firm belief since the start that you can only get better at Software Development by
                actually
                DEVELOPING SOFTWARE (obvious right ?) and yet most people engage in endless sprints of watching tutorial
                after
                tutorial to add new buzz words to their Resumes. Most coding-centric platforms online have catered to
                the
                problem-solving aspects of programming, which while giving you a good understanding of the fundamentals
                of
                the
                language and engaging your intellect have diminishing returns after a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I set out to build this platform with hopes of providing a safe space for developers to share their
                projects,
                get feedback from the community and learn from one another.
            </p>

            <h2>Deciding on a Stack</h2>

            <!--!!NB: Remember to put a semicolon after your dt's with ::after-->

            <dl id="finalize-tech-stack">
                <dt>
                    Once I wrote down all the features I would want to make the experience truly unique, I set out to
                    finalize a
                    tech stack. I needed the following attributes:
                </dt>
                <dd>Easy to Scale and Deploy</dd>
                <dd>A Good ORM with a strong API and support for formatted output on Raw Queries. </dd>
                <dd>React on the frontend (it’s 2021 or 2022 by the time you read this)</dd>
                <dd>Excellent SEO Support</dd>
                <dd>PWA Support</dd>
                <dd>Admin tools that were served separately from the main website</dd>
                <dd>Social Authentication</dd>
                <dd>GitHub Integration so that users can link their repositories.</dd>
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>For each requirement, I put together a list of possible technologies/frameworks.</p>
            <h2>The Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Frontend: <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a></li>
                <li>Backend: <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a></li>
                <li>Database: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM</li>
                <li>Admin Tools: <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/">react-admin</a></li>
                <li>DevOps: GitHub Actions, Vercel CLI, and Docker</li>
                <li>Hosting:</li>
                <li>AWS EC2 (Backend)</li>
                <li>Vercel (Both Frontends)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Next.js ?</h2>
            <p>
                As stated earlier SEO was crucial for me, and with create-react-app you subscribe to Client-Side
                Rendering which
                will not play well with Web Crawlers of Search Engines (they do not execute JS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Next.js supports <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>(Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site
                Generation), and ISR (Incremental Static
                Regeneration). I’ll summarize each in simple terms below:
            </p>

            <dl>
                <div>
                    <dt>
                        <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Essentially serves documents with all the components rendered and populated with necessary data
                        (from
                        APIs). This way a bot can see all the info without the need for JavaScript execution. This makes
                        serving
                        pages with no real-time updates like Blogs, Profile data etc simple and allows for good SEO.
                    </dd>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <dt>
                        <abbr title="Static Site Generation">SSG</abbr>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        It serves purely static pages (No API data), and offers good SEO at the same time. Useful for
                        things
                        like documentation.
                    </dd>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <dt>
                        <abbr title="Incremental Static Regeneration">ISR</abbr>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        It’s like SSR but it periodically refreshes the static Pages with new API data. Useful for
                        things
                        like blogs and profiles where updates may not be frequent but do happen and must be reflected.
                        Bonus: Next.js and Vercel have the perfect ecosystem.
                    </dd>
                </div>
            </dl>

            <p>Bonus: Next.js and Vercel have the perfect ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Authentication: next-auth</h2>

            <p>
                It couples perfectly with Next.js, it is served as a serverless function via Next.js which fully
                supports
                them and Vercel does too in production, so no extra configurations. You can even remotely monitor the
                function and check for errors through Vercel. It is perfect in every way, you should just look at their
                website to learn more.
            </p>

            <p>
                The docs were simple and I was able to set up Google and GitHub authentication in under an hour (had to
                wait
                for Google to sync callback URLs).
            </p>

            <h2>Component Library: material-ui</h2>

            <p>
                I started the project before the Tailwind hype train hit its peak. And I did eventually try it on
                another
                project, but it’s not my kind of thing. I’m very good at pure CSS already so I went with material-ui, it
                comes with a good set of components out of the box and a few more from other community-made packages
                like
                treasury, pickers, etc.
            </p>

            <h2>Admin Tools: react-admin</h2>

            <p>
                It comes with a good set of tools out of the box it makes use of material-ui (so easier to customize and
                share components). Plus you can easily assign roles and give restricted access to different aspects of
                the
                App.
            </p>

            <h2>Backend: Express.js</h2>

            <p>
                Express has been around since forever and it is pretty much the go-to for most people. I added a few
                packages like express-sequelize-crud so that I could allow my admin tools to query it easily without the
                need for more endpoints. Secured all the endpoints with JWT authentication and set up Role-Based
                Permissions.
            </p>

            <h2>Database: PostgreSQL</h2>

            <p>
                This project was going to have a lot of interlinked tables, so No SQL was not going to cut it. I also
                needed
                support for JSON documents to store certain nested data (Resumes). PostgreSQL also supports Full-Text
                Search
                (FTS) out of the box which made it easier to build a feature-rich Search option.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sequelize was good, it supported TS_Vectors out of the box which was necessary for me to build FTS
                supported
                documents. And the support for formatted Raw Queries made writing joins simpler (kind of a pain doing it
                through the ORM’s native API).
            </p>

            <h2>Deployment</h2>

            <dl>
                <dt>So my deployment workflow goes as follows</dt>
                <dd>Merge a Pull Request to main which triggers GitHub Actions.</dd>
                <dd>Build Preview Deployments for the admin and main website on Vercel.</dd>
                <dd>Once the Preview build is built successfully, promote it to production. (I get notifications for
                    each step on Slack thanks to a sweet Slack Integration). </dd>
                <dd>In parallel, a docker image is created with contents of the backend code and pushed to my EC2
                    instance, where it's run with pm2. A script then performs necessary database migrations via
                    sequelize-cli.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

            <p>It was a great journey building out the whole project by myself, I learned a lot of things along the way including Canva and Figma. Spent a lot of time binging YC Startup School videos to figure out my pitch, website content. I also tweeted my entire journey on my Twitter (drop by and say hi! Replying on medium has been weird since forever), which was great because I got to connect with a lot of cool people.</p>

            <p>I’m excited to close this article by saying <a href="https://skillshack.dev/" target="_blank">skillShack(⚡);</a> is live at <a href="https://skillshack.dev/" target="_blank">skillshack.dev</a> !</p>

            <p>Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments and see you on the website!</p>
