            <p>
                With “<a href="https://skillshack.dev/" target="_blank">skillShack(⚡)</a>” I wanted to build a platform
                for
                developers to share the projects they are working on, and
                for those stuck in tutorial hell provide a curated list of challenges that can be built into projects to
                put
                their skills to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been my firm belief since the start that you can only get better at Software Development by
                actually
                DEVELOPING SOFTWARE (obvious right ?) and yet most people engage in endless sprints of watching tutorial
                after
                tutorial to add new buzz words to their Resumes. Most coding-centric platforms online have catered to
                the
                problem-solving aspects of programming, which while giving you a good understanding of the fundamentals
                of
                the
                language and engaging your intellect have diminishing returns after a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I set out to build this platform with hopes of providing a safe space for developers to share their
                projects,
                get feedback from the community and learn from one another.

            <h2>Deciding on a Stack</h2>

            <p>Once I wrote down all the features I would want to make the experience truly unique, I set out to
                finalize a tech stack. I needed the following attributes:</p>


            <!--The data-ul attribute is to identify ul's specificially posted by the author to this particular article as opposed to surrounding ul's on the page like on the navigation links in the main menu of the website-->

            <ul data-ul="article-ul">
                <li>Easy to Scale and Deploy</li>
                <li>A Good ORM with a strong API and support for formatted output on Raw Queries. </li>
                <li>React on the frontend (it’s 2021 or 2022 by the time you read this)</li>
                <li>Excellent SEO Support</li>
                <li>PWA Support</li>
                <li>Admin tools that were served separately from the main website</li>
                <li>Social Authentication</li>
                <li>GitHub Integration so that users can link their repositories.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>For each requirement, I put together a list of possible technologies/frameworks.</p>


            <hr>
            <!--Shift in topic-->
            <h2>The Stack</h2>

            <ul data-ul="article-ul">

            <h2>Why Next.<abbr title="javascript">js</abbr>?</h2>

            <p>
                As stated earlier SEO was crucial for me, and with create-react-app you subscribe to Client-Side
                Rendering which
                will not play well with Web Crawlers of Search Engines (they do not execute <abbr
                    title="javascript">JS</abbr>).
            </p>

            <p>
                Next.<abbr title="javascript">js</abbr> supports <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>(Server
                Side Rendering), <abbr title="Static Site Generation">SSG</abbr> (Static Site
                Generation), and <abbr title="Incremental Static Regeneration">ISR</abbr> (Incremental Static
                Regeneration). I’ll summarize each in simple terms below:
            </p>

            <dl>
                <div>
                    <dt>
                        <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Essentially serves documents with all the components rendered and populated with necessary data
                        (from
                        <abbr title="Application Program Interface">APIs</abbr>). This way a bot can see all the info
                        without the need for JavaScript execution. This makes
                        serving
                        pages with no real-time updates like Blogs, Profile data etc simple and allows for good <abbr
                            title="Search Engine Optimizatio">SEO</abbr>.
                    </dd>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <dt>
                        <abbr title="Static Site Generation">SSG</abbr>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        It serves purely static pages (No <abbr title="Application Program Interface">APIs</abbr> data),

            <h2>Authentication: next-auth</h2>

            <p>
                It couples perfectly with Next.<abbr title="javascript">js</abbr>, it is served as a serverless function
                via Next.js which fully
                supports
                them and Vercel does too in production, so no extra configurations. You can even remotely monitor the
                function and check for errors through Vercel. It is perfect in every way, you should just look at their
                <a href="https://next-auth.js.org/" target="_blank">website</a> to learn more.

                The docs were simple and I was able to set up Google and GitHub authentication in under <time
                    datetime="PT1H">an hour</time> (had to wait for Google to sync callback <abbr

            <h2>Component Library: material-<abbr title="User Interface">ui</abbr></h2>

            <p>
                I started the project before the Tailwind hype train hit its peak. And I did eventually try it on
                another
                project, but it’s not my kind of thing. I’m very good at pure <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> already so I went with material-<abbr
                    title="User Interface">ui</abbr>, it
                comes with a good set of components out of the box and a few more from other community-made packages
                like
                treasury, pickers, etc.

            <h2>Admin Tools: react-admin</h2>

            <p>
                It comes with a good set of tools out of the box it makes use of material-<abbr
                    title="User Interface">ui</abbr> (so easier to customize and
                share components). Plus you can easily assign roles and give restricted access to different aspects of
                the
                App.

            <h2>Backend: Express.<abbr title="javascript">js</abbr></h2>

            <p>
                Express has been around since forever and it is pretty much the go-to for most people. I added a few
                packages like express-sequelize-crud so that I could allow my admin tools to query it easily without the
                need for more endpoints. Secured all the endpoints with <abbr title="Jason Web Token">JWT</abbr>
                authentication and set up Role-Based
                Permissions.

            <h2>Database: Postgre<abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr></h2>

            <p>
                This project was going to have a lot of interlinked tables, so No SQL was not going to cut it. I also
                needed
                support for <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> documents to store certain nested data
                (Resumes). Postgre<abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> also supports Full-Text
                Search
                (<abbr title="Full-Text Search">FTS</abbr>) out of the box which made it easier to build a feature-rich
                Search option.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sequelize was good, it supported <abbr title="Time series">TS</abbr>_Vectors out of the box which was
                necessary for me to build <abbr title="Full-Text Search">FTS</abbr>
                supported
                documents. And the support for formatted Raw Queries made writing joins simpler (kind of a pain doing it
                through the <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</abbr>’s native <abbr
                    title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>).

            <h2>Deployment</h2>

            <p>So my deployment workflow goes as follows</p>
            <ul data-ul="article-ul">
                <li>Merge a Pull Request to main which triggers GitHub Actions.</li>
                <li>Build Preview Deployments for the admin and main website on Vercel.</li>
                <li>Once the Preview build is built successfully, promote it to production. (I get notifications for
                    each step on Slack thanks to a sweet Slack Integration). </li>
                <li>In parallel, a docker image is created with contents of the backend code and pushed to my <abbr
                        title="Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud">EC2</abbr>
                    instance, where it's run with <abbr title="Production Process Manager for Node.js">pm2</abbr>. A
                    script then performs necessary database migrations via
                    sequelize-<abbr title="Command Line Interface">cli</abbr>.</li>

            <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

            <p>It was a great journey building out the whole project by myself, I learned a lot of things along the way
                including Canva and Figma. Spent a lot of time binging <abbr title="Y Combinator">YC</abbr> Startup
                School videos to figure out my pitch,
                website content. I also tweeted my entire journey on my <a href="https://twitter.com/sushrit_lawliet"
                    target="_blank">Twitter</a> (drop by and say hi! Replying on medium
                has been weird since forever), which was great because I got to connect with a lot of cool people.</p>

            <p>I’m excited to close this article by saying <a href="https://skillshack.dev/"
